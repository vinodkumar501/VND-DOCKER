Whenever possible, use current official images as the basis for your images. We recommend the Alpine image as it is tightly controlled and small in size 
(currently under 6 MB), while still being a full Linux distribution.
adds files from your Docker clientâ€™s current directory.

RUN 
builds your application with make.

CMD 
specifies what command to run within the container.
